{"name":"OpenRobot","tagline":"NXT Programming Made Simple","body":"[openrobot]() - A Simple Compile-To-C Language For NXT Programming\r\n=========\r\n[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/shrimpboyho/openrobot/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/shrimpboyho/openrobot/latest)\r\n\r\n```openrobot``` is a simple platform for programming NXT robots built atop of ```NeXT Btye Codes``` (NBC). At it's core, ```openrobot``` takes simple source code as input and generates C output. This C output is then fed into the ```nbc``` compiler where NXT instructions can be generated.\r\n\r\n##The Language\r\n\r\n```openrobot``` has a language of its own that is heavily based off Python. Here is some sample source code:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# This is a test program to be parsed\r\n\r\nspeed = 4\r\n\r\ndef move():\r\n  speed = speed + 1\r\n  print speed\r\n\r\ndef main():\r\n  move()\r\n```\r\n\r\n##How To Use\r\n\r\nSetting up ```openrobot``` is quite easy. Make sure you have ```Python 2.7```.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/shrimpboyho/openrobot.git\r\ncd openrobot\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom here you can run the tests.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\npython robotpy tests/test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Why?\r\n\r\n```openrobot``` was created with education in mind. By exposing students and hobbyists to a simple programming language, the transition from GUI based programming to text based programming can be easily done. ```openrobot``` avoids archaic syntax and represents logic in a manner heavily based off of ```python```.\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
